Hi XYZ, 

I enjoyed reading your substack article on apple's new prouduct launch on emojis. [one line to show that you have researched about them]. Hopefully it supports animations in future. [give them an idea that can be useful to them].

I am about to end my graduate studies at UMCP am am looking for AI Engineering / MLE related full time opportunities. I did love to hear more about your team.

Would you be open to a quick 10min call on Thursday 12PM IST ?

Thanks,
Sarvesh
