Hi XYZ, 

I enjoyed reading your substack article on apple's new prouduct launch on emojis. [one line to show that you have researched about them]. Hopefully it supports animations in future. [give them an idea that can be useful to them].

I am about to end my graduate studies at UMCP am am looking for AI Engineering / MLE related full time opportunities. I did love to hear more about your team.

Would you be open to a quick 10min call on Thursday 12PM IST ?

Thanks,
Sarvesh

Step 3 (Manual) : Send message on Linkedin (preferred) / Email (if you have one but risk of being blocked by their company's email blocker) (cold emailing works bro no doubut use websites like appolo / hunter to get emails and mail hiring managers and HRs)





# Brainstoming
- Now it does not makes sense to analyse linkedin post of recruiters (HRs) it only makes sense to analyse linkedin post of hiring manager becuase they will post technical stuff and not the HRs
- Got to know that cold emailing works for both big tech like google / meta and also for startups
